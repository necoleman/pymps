# PYMPS: Method of Particular Solutions, in Python, for Eigenvalue Problems

Adapted from Betcke-Trevethen, 2003, *Reviving the Method of Particular 
Solutions.*

Currently running into a bug where all singular values of the slice of Q 
I'm interested in are 1. This is probably because that slice is still 
orthogonal.
